# 16 - Least Square Approximations

In this chapter we come to an important application of projections, and we come across what is perhaps the most basic formula of statistics when we are trying to predict something.

As usual we are trying to fit a linear hyperplane to a set of points, we call it **linear regression**.

So here approximating `Ax=b` what will A, x and b be?

A = The individual points that have to be fit.
x = The vector of weights for each feature
b = The vector of independant variable ( the prediction to be made )

Here estimating x is essentially estimating the weights of the variables.

So we are done estimating variables and fiting them to a hyperplane.
