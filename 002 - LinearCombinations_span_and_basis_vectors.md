# Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors

* i vector is unit vector along x-axix and j is unit vector along y-axis.

* i and j are the Basis of the Coordinate System (and everything else is just scaling these basis in the coordinate system).

* **Basis**: The Basis of a vector is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.

* **Linear combination** is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results (e.g. a linear combination of x and y would be any expression of the form ax + by, where a and b are constants).

* The choice of basis vector matters when choosing a coordinate system.

* **Span** : Span of two vectors is set of all linear combinations (ie the points they can reach).

* If adding two vectors keeps the resultant vector span in the same dimension then they are Linearly dependent , and if their addition adds a new span of dimensions then they are “Linear independent”.

* Same concept of Basis and Span is followed in 3 dimensions as well. Where Linear combination of 3 vectors can span the entire 3-D space.
