# Practice Problems

### 1. Which of the following is true for any matrix A?  
**_NOTE_: dim(C(A)) ==> dimension of column space of A, dim(N(A)) ==> dimension of null space of A**  
* rank(A) > dim(C(A))
* dim(C(A)) = dim(N(A))
* dim(N(A)) + dim(C(A)) = dimension of whole vector space
* None

  >  _dim(N(A)) + dim(C(A)) = dimension of whole vector space_
</details>

### 2. Let A, B, C, D be n × n matrices. If ABCD = 1, then B<sup>-1</sup>?
* D<sup>-1</sup>C<sup>-1</sup>A<sup>-1</sup>
* CDA
* ADC
* None
* Insufficient information

  >  _Insufficient information. Since it is not given that the matrices are invertible. If invertible the answer would be ==> CDA_

### 3. Find a transformation matrix in 3D space, that first rotates the space about X axis by 270<sup>o</sup>, then rotates the resulting space about its Y axis by 90<sup>o</sup> and finally rotates the resulting space about its Z axis by 180<sup>o</sup> (All rotations in clockwise direction)

  Let A ==> Rotation about X by -270<sup>o</sup>  
      B ==> Rotation about Y by -90<sup>o</sup>  
      C ==> Rotation about Z by -180<sup>o</sup> since clockwise*  
  A = 
  
  |   1   |   0   |   0   |
  | :---: | :---: | :---: |
  |   0   |   0   |   1   |
  |   0   |  -1   |   0   |

  B = 
  
  |   0   |   0   |  -1   |
  | :---: | :---: | :---: |
  |   0   |   1   |   0   |
  |   1   |   0   |   0   |

  C = 
  
  |  -1   |   0   |   0   |
  | :---: | :---: | :---: |
  |   0   |   1   |   0   |
  |   0   |   0   |   1   |

  Resultant transformation = **C x B x A**  
  Think why preorder multiplication?

  >  _No, Since zero vector is not present_
</details>

### 5. Does all natural numbers in range (-∞, 0] form a vector space or sub space? Justify

<details>
  <summary>View Answer</summary>
    
  >  _For any space to be a vector space/subspace, there should be closure i.e resultant vector after 
  linear transformation should lie in same space. But here the resultant can be positive and hence
  the answer is NO_
</details>
