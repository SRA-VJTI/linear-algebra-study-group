# Assignment 5: Implementing Simple linear Regression

Implement a simple linear regression model from scratch using only numpy and other basic libraries (sklearn only for loading datasets)

Implement it on the following datasets:
1. Iris between Petal Length and Petal Width (learn to split data on your own :))(10 points)
2. (Bonus 10 points) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors Verify accuracy of Moore's law from the data available here (no libs allowed for OLS regression).
