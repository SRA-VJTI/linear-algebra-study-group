## Assignment
Q) Write a program to find a Reduced row echelon form, x<sub>particular</sub>, x<sub>nullspace</sub>, x<sub>complete</sub> solutions of a given Ax = b in which matrix A of any shape (mxn) . You can use any programming language, however use of any linear algebra/mathematical library is not allowed.

You need to submit the code and screenshot of the result.

Input:
* Matrix A
* Matrix b

Result should print the following:
* Reduced Row echelon form matrix
* x<sub>particular</sub>
* x<sub>nullspace</sub>
* x<sub>complete</sub>

Make sure the code is well commented.
